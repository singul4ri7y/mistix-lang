@ A simple test of closures.
@ Written by SD Asif Hossein.

fn counter[] {
    @ 'i' will be enclosed by the function 'count'!
    var i = 0;

    @ Function within a function.
    fn count[] {
        @ 'i' is getting enclosed!
        i = i + 1
        ret i
    }

    ret count
}

var count = counter();

print(count());    @ Expected output: '1'
print(count());    @ Expected output: '2'
